- [x] Latex of PS?
  - latex lijkt kut, maar je kan op zich wel makkelijk boxes en whatever maken (twee collumen, of allemaal 
  rijen met _n_-collumen als een soort grid)
- [x] Font
  - examples/scientific-poster-template_blah.png
- [x] Make font bigger (can only be done by https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/243678/how-to-make-tikzposter-work-with-font-sizes-larger-than-25pt i think)
- [x] 3 columns met in het midden afbeeldingen
- [x] Title
  - Bigger, bolder (HUGE size?)
  - horitzontal layout
    - Two collumny, like Firbushposter2.png
- [x] Blocktitles
  - Consider a light blue background
    - coupled with white text?
    - Gradients?
    - removes the need for larrger outlines so you can make them blak and sharp
    - Make title backgrounds slide in as in scientific-poster-template-portrait-portrait-poster-template-poster-presentation-template-portrait.png
- [x] The title looks weird with all other black text
  - esp with the author thingy
  - So consider making everything grayish and giving the titles a bg (like above)
- [ ] Subitizing example
 - Elephants
 - The OG 5?
- [ ] Maybe you can do a hierarchical graph of a brain thingy to point to structural similarities
- [ ] Reread Pointe (?) for the working of subitizing (something with the visiospatial system)
- [x] math font is weird
  - Still kinda weird but less weird
- [x] Alternating colors automatically is too much work and sometimes unneeded, specify manually
- [x] make bold text also darkblue
- [x] consider making the UvA logo blue
- [x] Short introduction with whatt we did, without title?
  - Seperate from the rest with a horitzontal line
- [x] Maybe it's just me, but the spacing between lines seems kinda large
- [x] Choose a light blue based on hexcolor/xcolor
- [ ] Andere synthetische afbeeldingen? je had nog zo'n map voor de eindpresentatie
- [ ] remove the car from the dfc compare thingy
  - whait i think the width of the image is not that much of a problem
- [x] Citations
  - consider shorter styles (less info)
  - long thingy at the bottom
- [x] Lines can be a tiny bit "shaper" so less tick and a tinsy bit more black
- [x] give optimization the breadth so like
    [fpl blahh blah   ] 	[synthetic data]
    [white background ]     [bluegray background]
    [dfc compare image]     [synthetic images]
 - [x] instead of the breadth thing above, try the background only on the
       lower textblocks
       	   - The easiest way to do this is probaly to have two innerblocks,
           one with the two images and one the two texts. And then place
           stuff horizontal in those innerblocks
           - probably needs a vertical seperation line tho
- [x] Make table lines blue as well?
- [ ] make table full width
  - or just make it's block small, like now
- [x] make references font smaller
- [x] glitchty corner stuff
- [x] the elephants picture is (looks?) not centered 
  - vspace ftw
- [x] references do not look centered
  - Probably okay now
- [x] The last innerblock needs to be a tiny bit round to not 
- [ ] higher (not like completely) quality qualative analysis render 
  - change font and background
- [x] research into the poster size
  - 1.20x1.00m 
    - a0 fits, but anything larger doesn't
- [x] maybe have the size dectectors next to the performance
  - and then the big bird somewhere underthere
- [x] make the birds background transparent
- [ ] measure things to see if they are off
  - digital ruler? (linux?)
  - see posterRules.pdf, some minor changes are required.
- [ ] make the seperator line start and stop, like the columnn sep
  - or make the column sep longer?
- [x] The title and intro don't line up with the blocks
  - they seem to do now but check on ur macbook
- [ ] nice vdots
- [ ] syntethic images are vertically off

# Contents

- [ ] Maybe make everything more bulletpoint like?
- [ ] u forgot the whole emergence zozori stuff
  - mention in the subitizing thing? (or is this double with the into)
  - read back the original paper for a formulation
- [ ] List the contributions similair to tom's example in the intro
  - theory: (emergent (do we use this term)) numerosity estimation
  - method: unsupervised VAE (hierachical?/cnn paratemerized) (with training optimizations)
  - Dataset:  (less important, **mention something else?**) SOS?
  - Evaluation: performs okay and possiblly anougolous with brain functioning
- [ ] Tell something about the other methods in the subitizing performance thing
  - Start with "We evaluate our model's subitizing performance on...(SOS test set, frozen parameters)"
- [ ] If you need a slight explanition with the qualative analysis skip the birdies
  - ask Tom if he would rather have the birdies or 
  - remember to learn the argument on why our evaluation is noisier
    - Each dimension encodes more than one property
- [ ] Introduction
  - Read the abstract and conclusion and see if u missed anything
- [ ] fpl can probably use a reference
- [ ] In the VAE thing, mention more like why they are an interesting thinh
      - unsupervised blah blah, also see tom's text about parametrization 
        and stuff
            - parameterized by hierachical/deep CNNs(check terminology of paper)
      - Include a graph? Like just the one you made and ask if tom likes the 
        idea and then remake it 
            - graph or formula? or both?
    - if you're gonna keep the formula in it's probably a good idea to 
    study up on it somemore 
        - i.e. have something interesting to say about it
          - So I guess that the 2nd term just stands for
            Q(z|X) learned mu and sigma that encode data into z's
          - The first term is
          1. z is actually a complicated learned function generation zs
          2. this z function is parameterized by learned thetas that given 
             the data learns to generate the parameters (i.e. mu, sigma) 
             of probablisttic model that best fits the input
             This is called **Maximum likelihood estimation**. https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-concepts-explained-maximum-likelihood-estimation-c7b4342fdbb1)
             (and then the reconstruction term sort measures how well these 
             parameters do according to some kind of similarity measure (but 
             this is only for the updates?))
- [ ] Table have a caption sorta explaining how to read it
- [ ] Reference to Kingma2013auto?
- [ ] VAE figure
  - make it first, explain it later?
  - Is the objective function important enough?
- [ ] Have references under subitizing results as a block so there's space for a bird picture
- [ ] Maybe do neuroscience stuff in the subitizing thingy (if u have text make sure to inlude an other figure at the other side of the block)
  - uhm idk brain organization? graphs from harvey?
- [ ] note the lack of reparameterization trick somewhere?
